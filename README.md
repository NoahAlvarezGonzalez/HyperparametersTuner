# HyperparametersTuner

https://hyperparameters-tuner-app-noah.herokuapp.com/

# Goal

Show the effect of the hyperparameters on a model accuracy.

# Requirement

* Streamlit : to showcase the app
* Sklearn : to work with the classifiers & use PCA
* Matplotlib : to plot the data

# How it works

* The user can choose between multiple datasets and classifiers
* Once choosen, he can tweek the parameters using the slider on the left
* Accuracy will then vary in real time

# To Do

* Upload your own dataset
* Add more classifiers
